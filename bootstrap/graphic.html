	<h3>What is Graphic Design?</h3>
	<p>Graphic design is the process of visual communication and problem-solving through the use of typography, photography and illustration.

They use typography, visual arts, and page layout techniques to create visual compositions. Common uses of graphic design include corporate design (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), advertising, web design, communication design, product packaging and signage.</p>
